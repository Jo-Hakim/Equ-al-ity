        <h2>
          Equity  
        </h2>
        <p>
            Equity refers to the ownership value of an asset or company after all debts and liabilities have been subtracted. In the context of finance, equity represents the amount of money that would be returned to shareholders if all assets were liquidated and all debts paid off. It can also refer to the ownership interest that shareholders have in a company, often represented by stock or shares. Equity is a key measure of financial health and investment potential.

                <li>
                    Make job descriptions accessible
                    <p>
                        This means having transparency around the wage range for different positions, as well as providing a variety of avenues through which talent may access application materials (including non-web-based channels).

                </li>
                <li>
                    Shift to skills-based hiring
                    <p>
                        Not everyone has access to higher education and this shouldn’t bar them from opportunities for work if they have the skills necessary to do the job. This is the gist of skills-based hiring. Instead of focusing on specific degree requirements in your hiring process, emphasize skills and previous work experience. Then, leverage your existing L&D resources to upskill and reskill these individuals for continuous career advancement.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide inclusive incentives
                    <p>
                        Event-based incentives that center around alcohol or formal dress codes have the potential to alienate some employees. Financial or recognition-based incentives are a better way to reward top-performing team members and avoid exclusion.

              equality  
            </h2>
            <p>
                Equality is the state of being equal, especially in status, rights, and opportunities. It implies that every individual or group is given the same resources or chances, without discrimination based on characteristics such as race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. Equality aims to ensure that everyone has a fair and level playing field in various aspects of life, including education, employment, and legal rights.

                <h3>
                    Here are some examples of equality
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Racial equality
                        <p>
                            when a society has racial equality, it means no one is oppressed or discriminated against because of their race. True equality goes deeper than this, however, and requires a shift in how we define “race” in the first place. While racism is real, race is a social and political – not a biological – construct. 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gender equality
                        <p>
                            In gender-equal societies, no one is discriminated against based on their gender. There are a handful of societies where equality between men and women is nearly achieved. For over a decade, Iceland has ranked the highest according to the Global Gender Gap Index 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        LGBTQ+ equality
                        <p>
                            According to the Pew Research Center, equality and acceptance for the LGBTQ+ community are “sharply divided” by economic development, region, and country. Younger people, educated people, and people from Western countries tend to be more accepting. On the other hand, those with favorable views of Europe’s right-wing populist parties tend to be less accepting.
